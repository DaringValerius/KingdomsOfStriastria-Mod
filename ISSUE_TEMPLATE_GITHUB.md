===================

Please, before reporting bugs, ask yourself:

*Are you in the latest version?*

Reporting bugs from an older version isn't a good idea. 
A newer version of the mod may have solved the issue you're experiencing.
If you are using a modpack, try updating the mod manually.
If that works, ask the modpack creator(s) to update the mod.

*Are you in the latest version of Forge?*

Often times, the newer versions of Forge will contain major bugfixes.
If an issue can be reproduced in an old version, but not a newer version, then the mod works fine.

If you aren't using vanilla Forge, that could be another issue entirely.

*Are you using Optifine?*

Optifine is a closed source mod. Workarounds aren't possible without violating the license.
That's the reason many mods do not support Optifine.
If something looks out of place, you uninstall Optifine and the mod works fine, then it has to do with the interaction
between the mod and Optifine.

=================== 

- Issues with MCPC, etc. that are not reproducible with only Forge will not be accepted
- Issues regarding older versions of the mod will not be accepted
- Duplicate issues will be closed without asking
- Do not tag your issues (ex: "[BUG] Something's not right").There's a label system in place.
- Suggestions will be accepted as an issue.
